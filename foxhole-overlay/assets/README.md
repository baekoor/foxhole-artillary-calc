## Icon File

Place your tray icon as `icon.png` in this directory.

Recommended specifications:
- Size: 256x256 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Design: Simple, recognizable icon (e.g., artillery cannon, crosshair, or Foxhole logo)

For now, the app will work with an empty icon if none is provided.

You can create an icon using:
- Online icon generators
- Image editing software (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
- Icon libraries (Font Awesome, Material Icons, etc.)
